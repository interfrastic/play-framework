# Ebean ORM Demo

This project demonstrates how each of the basic relationships possible
between two entities is represented in the Ebean ORM and how these
relationships are mapped to tables in a MySQL database.

The initial project was created by following
[these instructions](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.9/NewApplication)
to create a new vanilla Play Java application, like this:
    
```
activator new ebeandemo play-java
```
